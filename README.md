PyTarotAI: Interactive Tarot Fortune Teller
Introduction
PyTarotAI is a Python project that allows users to experience an interactive Tarot fortune-telling session using the power of the OpenAI API. The program simulates a Tarot card reading experience by shuffling a deck, letting users draw cards, and providing interpretations for their questions.

Receive interpretations: The program provides authentic-sounding interpretations based on the drawn cards and their positions.

Ask questions: Users can ask their questions to the virtual Tarot master and receive personalized responses.
